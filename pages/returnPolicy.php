            WHAT IS OUR RETURN POLICY?<br><br>

            <span class="font-normal">
                You can return any item & exchange it for a different size or colour within 7 days of receiving your original order.
                If you want it replaced for a different size or color, or you want a different item, you will need to place a new order or
                you can exchange it from our Elegant wardrobe showrooms.
                Items returned must be in their original condition, which includes tags and any packaging e.g. shoes must be returned
                with the original shoe box.
                You can exchange the items with the receipt from our Elegant wardrobe showrooms island wide.
                All goods will be inspected on return.
                The goods are your responsibility until they reach our customer care team or showrooms, so make sure it’s packed
                up properly and can’t get damaged on the way!
                We are not responsible for any items that are returned to us by mistake.
                In the unlikely event that an item is returned to us in an unsuitable condition, we may have to return it back to you.
            </span>

            <br><br> HOW DO I RETURN SOMETHING TO YOU?<br><br>

            <span class="font-normal">
                We would like to offer you a hassle-free way to return anything, so you can return any item to us within 30 days of
                receiving your original order, including sale items.
                You can make your own arrangements through any other carrier (there may be a charge for this). The parcel remains
                your responsibility until it arrives with us, so remember to ask for proof of postage if you choose to send it via another
                carrier, in case it goes missing.
                Make sure the returns form is filled out with your order number and placed in your returns parcel – we can’t process
                your return without these details.
                If you want a different size or color, or you want a different item, you will need to place a new order.

                Have you lost your returns note or label? Just contact our Customer Care Team on 077 354 0816
                We’ll send you an email as soon as we’ve received your return in its original condition as an acknowledgment.
                We try hard to accept all returns possible. Returns to us don’t need to be in the original packaging. In the unlikely
                event that an item is returned to us in an unsuitable condition, we may have to send it back to you
            </span>

            <br><br>CAN I REFUND ?<br><br>

            <span class="font-normal">
                This is unless your order was cancelled before the items were dispatched or the entire order was faulty.
                THE PRODUCT CODE ON MY DELIVERY NOTE IS DIFFERENT FROM THE WEBSITE
                Don’t worry, the product code on your delivery note is the one you need to use if you are querying or returning something.
                It’s unique to the size and color combination of your item.
            </span>

            <br><br>HAVE YOU RECEIVED MY RETURNED ITEMS?<br><br>

            <span class="font-normal">
                Don’t worry as soon as your return has been received and checked by our Customer Care, we’ll email you to let you know.
                In the unlikely event that you haven’t received an email within 10 days of returning your items contact our Customer
                Care Team and we’ll get back to you within 24 hours.
                Make sure you let us know your original order number, which items you have returned and any delivery reference
                numbers (i.e. from a carrier) when you contact us.
            </span>

            <br><br>I HAVE BEEN REFUNDED THE INCORRECT AMOUNT<br><br>
            <span class="font-normal">
                We’re really sorry if we’ve made a mistake with your refund!
                If this is the case, please contact our Customer Care Team and we’ll sort it out for you as soon as possible
                The following may affect the amount you have been refunded:
                The delivery charge, which is only refunded for cancelled orders or if the goods are faulty.
                Any discounts that were applied at the time of sale, which may not now be applicable.
